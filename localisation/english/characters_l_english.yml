 ENG_mosley_name:0 "Oswald Mosley"
 ENG_mosley_description:0 "Oswald Mosley, born in 1896 into a family of wealth and privilege, emerged as a prominent British politician in the early 20th century. Educated at the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Mosley served in World War I before entering politics. \n\nInitially aligned with the Conservative Party, Mosley's political journey took a dramatic turn as he shifted towards socialism, eventually founding the New Party in 1931. However, disillusioned with the party's progress, he formed the New Party of Maximalists in 1932, espousing authoritarian, nationalist and socialist ideologies. \n\nThe NPM gained notoriety for its populist appeal and controversial tactics, including street violence and anti-Semitic rhetoric. Despite facing opposition and condemnation, Mosley remained a charismatic and polarizing figure, commanding a dedicated following. \n\nMosley's sympathies typically resonate with the ideology of Benito Mussolini, and despite never meeting in person, their mutual antipathy towards the Russian Empire forms a strong bond between them."

 BUL_boris_iii_description:0 "Born into the royal family in 1894, Boris III ascended to the throne in 1918 following the end of World War I and the collapse of neighboring empires. Despite his nominal sovereignty, Boris III's reign was heavily influenced by the Russian Empire, which held considerable sway over Bulgarian affairs. \n\nBoris III's political career is characterized by his role as the Bulgarian tsar, beholden to the interests and directives of the Russian tsar. Under Russian influence, Boris III pursued policies that aligned with the Empire's geopolitical agenda, often at the expense of Bulgaria's autonomy and national interests. He maintained a delicate balance between appeasing Russian authorities and managing domestic affairs, navigating the intricate web of power dynamics within the region. \n\nDespite his subservience to Russian interests, Boris III managed to maintain a degree of stability and prosperity within Bulgaria. He implemented reforms aimed at modernizing the economy and infrastructure, albeit often under Russian guidance. However, his collaboration with the Russian Empire also drew criticism from segments of Bulgarian society, who viewed him as a puppet ruler sacrificing national sovereignty for personal gain."

 GER_goring_description:0 "“The victor will always be the judge, and the vanquished the accused.” - §RHermann Göring§" \n\nMany men rise to prominence in the pages of history, but few with the multifaceted trajectory of Hermann Göring. Born on January 12, 1893, in Rosenheim, Germany, Göring's early life was marked by a blend of privilege and adversity. His father was a diplomat, affording Göring exposure to international circles, while his mother instilled in him a sense of duty and patriotism. \n\nGöring's path took a dramatic turn with the outbreak of World War I, during which he distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, earning the coveted Pour le Mérite, Germany's highest military honor. However, the war's end left him disillusioned with the political establishment, leading him to join the right-wing Deutschnationale Volkspartei. \n\nIn the turbulent aftermath of the war, Göring found a new purpose in politics, championing nationalist causes and advocating for a strong, unified Germany. His charisma and military background propelled him to prominence within the party, where he emerged as a leading figure promoting the National Vanguard ideology, and as he described it, the "blood and soil of Germany." \n\n
